### About

I am a software developer living on Long Island, NY.  I work from home doing business analysis and developing web applications for medical research with my two [parrolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrotlet) personal assistants.  Throughout my programming career I have developed in various languages and frameworks, but currently develop in C#/VB.NET on the .NET framework.  

To keep things interesting, I generally mess around with 3D/game programming and other non-web development side projects in my spare time.  I hope to share my thoughts, ideas, and processes on this blog.

I wrote this blog in [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/), host it in a [linux](https://www.linux.org/) environment,  and write the content in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

I was an ALT in the [JET Program](https://jetprogramusa.org/) and consider myself a life long learner of Japanese (日本語).  When I lived in Japan, I was told that a phone's email address should not link back to my name.  I thought llamas were pretty cool and fuzzy makes them sound cute and so afuzzyllama was born.

As with most blogs: **This blog contains my own views and opinions and in no way reflect the views and opinions of my employer.**
